* [Course Repo]()

## Section 1: Introduction

### Lecture 1. Programming languages for Embedded Systems

* C is still the most powerful and popular in Embedded Programming also C++

### Lecture 2. History of 'C' and standardization

* C89 C90 first (1989,1990) , then C99 (1999) then C11 (2011)
* we will use C11 standard with some compiler gCC extensions gnu11

## Section 2: IDE installation

### Lecture 4. Downloading IDE

* [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)
* we will use Eclipse based STM32CubeIDE developed by ST Microelectronics to write, compile and debug apps on STMew ARM mCUs
* STM32CubeIDE is an Eclipse Based ID customized for STM32
